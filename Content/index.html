                Ethan Post is a dedicated worker looking to challenge himself in the future. 
                His hobbies include Cloud Development, biking, cooking, keto, traveling, blah blah and more.
                He's a very capable individual and I'm really just looking for filler text right now. This one time Ethan and I went to a Ghost concert.
                That was pretty cool. Except all the drunk people. Actually, they also made it better. Weird stuff. Steak 'N' Shake is overrated. Golden 
                Corral too. He's pretty good at Rocket League, but unfortunately his friends keep him down. Also, he dabbles a tad in the guitar.</p>
