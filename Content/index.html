          Hi, my name is Ethan Post and I love to tinker with computers and
          various technologies. I currently have over 5 years of experience in
          DevOps and previous I worked 2 years as a Software Engineer. Lately
          I have been bouncing back and forth between studying and building
          nueral networks, and studying for my CKA.
        </p>
        <p>
          My true passions in life are learning new technologies and working on
          my personally projects that I hope someday will help others in
          someway. My favorite personal project that I have put together to date
          is my Notes project which can be found linked at the top of this page.
          In short I made all of my notes public on github and set up automation
          with github actions to publish these notes in a web format in case
          anyone can gain anything from the lessons I have learned in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another project that I am quite fond of is
          <a href="https://www.github.com/maker2413/yacm">
            yacm (yet another configuration manager)
          </a>. In short this project allows a user to define profiles for each
          of the systems they want to codify using a simplistic yaml syntax.
          Yacm allows you to define packages you want to install in a number of
          package managers, define services you want to enable with support for
          systemd and runit, and define user created exectuables you want to run
          between each of these steps. I use yacm to codify all of my personal
          machines and virtual machines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another key thing about me and many of the projects I have made is
          that I'm a huge emacs fan. In my perfect world emacs would be my full
          blown operating system, but due to the fact that it is single threaded
          and doesn't have a browser that can compete with most modern web
          browsers for now it will have to continue to only be 80% of my
          computer usage. It won't take long if you are poking around my github
          or my notes to notice that most of documentation and my notes are
          written in emacs org-mode, which is single handly the thing that made
          me start using emacs as I think it is my most powerful form of markup
          language I have ever seen.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm also not just a huge fan of linux and the open source world, but
          I have made a concerted effort to slowly cut intrusive technologies
          out of my life. I haven't booted into Windows in almost 2 years and I
          have deleted almost all social media out of life including LinkedIn,
          to the dismay of many of my employers and colleagues. Even though
          none of these big data collecting companies are going to notice the
          loss of one user I think it would be unjust for me to use technologies
          that I do not support the practices of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Someday I hope to find a way to make a living by helping advance the
          world in a better way. Whether this be through open source
          technologies or a way to develop technologies that can help better
          peoples lives that is my dream. For now though I just try to make an
          impact where I can outside of working for tech companies that never
          let their projects see the light of day outside of their ecosystem.
