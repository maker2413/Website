    <div style="text-align:center;" ng-include="'../widgets/headerbar.html'"></div>
    <p>This website is hosted on the cloud environment I have given the pet name of SquidsAWS. This cloud environment was started by me so that I could better understand AWS development and work towards getting certified in AWS development. I didnâ€™t just setup a cloud environment though I have also been codifying it as I go with cloudformation templates and ansible playbooks. All the code is in my github but I will explain bits of it.
    </p>
    <p>The SquidsAWS repo found here: <a href="https://github.com/maker2413/SquidsAWS">Github</a> is my repo that contains submodules of my other repos for this project. Inside the CloudFormationTemplates repo found here:<br><a href="https://github.com/maker2413/CloudFormationTemplates">Github</a> I have all my cloud formation templates to build many different things in my environment. These would be run in the following order:<br>
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>First you would run the IAM cft to setup the IAM policies and roles used by the other cfts: <a href="https://github.com/maker2413/CloudFormationTemplates/tree/master/SquidsIAM">Github</a></li>
        <li>Work in progress</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Work in progress...</p>
