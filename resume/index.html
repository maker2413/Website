    <p>Wow let's just get to the jist you want my resume I want you to have my resume I have two different download options for I have this simple download button:</p>
    <a style="font-size:35px;border-radius:25px;color:white;background-color:#787878;padding:15px 25px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;display:inline-block;" title="Download" href="about:blank">Download</a>
    <p>The above button is just a totally normal download button. It will give you the resume you so desire. <b>BUT</b>, I also have this complete overkill download button:</p>
    <!-- DEV NOTE MAKE THIS BUTTON SUPER FANCY -->
    <a style="font-size:35px;border-radius:25px;color:white;background-color:#787878;padding:15px 25px;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;display:inline-block;" title="Advanced Download" href="about:blank">Super Download</a>
    <p>Now this button is legendary! So basically because I was bored I setup and made a playbook to setup a jenkins instance. I then went on to never really use Jenkins all that much so I thought I would make the most overkill resume downloader ever. When you push the uber download button it starts a pipeline on my jenkins server. This pipeline spins up an ec2 instance as a node and checks out my Website repo on this node. It setups a temporary webserver and hosts basically a clone of this website you are currently on and then it downloads the resume to your device like usually. <i>Bing</i> <b>Bang</b> <b><i>Boom</b></i> you got a copy of my resume and it only cost you your time but that was a pretty cool setup huh.</p>
